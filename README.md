# Paint
This is an MS Paint-like program implemented in Java with JavaFX. I wrote this program as an assignment for CS250 Object Oriented Programming as a student at Valparaiso University. It was last modified in Fall 2019, but in Spring 2022 I realized that I had never updated the Github repository with my final version.
